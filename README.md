# IM_Experiment
Experiment about analyzing community graph which help us improve the influence maximization algorithm 

# Module
### format
Format the raw graph data. I provide three ways to generate the probability between two nodes.
```
./format -dataset path_to_dataset -flag your_flag
```

* flag = 0 probability is generated by 1/d(in), d(in) is the number of indegrees of a node'
* flag = 1 probability is generated by uniform distribution between [0, 1)
* flag = 2 probability is generated by normal distribution (mean, sigma*sigma)


### main
Analyze the graph data, calculate the influence diffusion after serveral steps
```
./main -attr path_to_attrbute -graph graph
```
**Attention: you can redirect the output stream to a file**
